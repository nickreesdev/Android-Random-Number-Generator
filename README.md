# Android-Random-Number-Generator
Random number generator for Android written in Kotlin.

## Why?
That's a pretty good question, actually. I'm not completely sure! I originally made this to just say "Hello, welcome to my app.", but I decided to make something somewhat useful for people, lol.

## Download!
The app is available on Google Play.
